# SDE 

This repository is for preparing for a SDE role.

Requirements for SDE role:(Contents from Cracking coding Interview Book)
1) Data Structures [Array, Strings, Queue, Stack, Linked List, Tress, Graphs, Tries, Heaps, Hashtables, Vectors]
2) Algorithms [Sorting, Searching, BFS, DFS]
3) Concepts [Bit manipulation, Memory, recursion, Dynamic programming, Time and Space complexity]
4) Projects 

Sources to learn and practise:
1) Bible : Introduction to Algorithm AKA CLRS 
2) Cracking the coding Inteview [CTCI] (most frequent interview questions)
3) Sites like Leetcode, GeeksForGeeks, Hackerank

I will be updating this repository with problems related to topics mentioned above in Python language.
All the problems are grouped together based on topics and problems with focus on solving CTCI book.
